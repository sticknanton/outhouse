# Outhouse

My final project for General Assembly WDI. A public bathroom finder based on user-submitted data; 
primarily built to function within major metropolitan areas (NYC). 
The app is built with a mobile-first agenda because honestly, if you're using your laptop with WiFi, you're already 
somewhere that has a public restroom.

This is a mean-stack application that employs google maps and token-based authentication. Logging in is not required to see 
the map, but is necessary to post new Outhouses to add ratings to pre-existing ones. Upon logging in, the layout changes just
slightly to add a hamburger icon to allow you to Logout, Add New or simply change the map to center itself somewhere else.
If you happen to know a couple of high quality and easily accessible bathrooms in Chicago, I'd want to make it easy for you to add them.

The map itself is loaded based on your current location and also has a control to recenter itself back to your location.
